TOOL USE

** IMPORTANT NOTE: YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO USE ANY TOOL(INCLUDING MCP TOOL) IN FIRST TIME YOU MUST READ SECTION TOOL USAGE WORKFLOW AND DO ACCORDING TO WORKFLOW IN ORDER STEP-BY-STEP WITHOUT SKIPING **

You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

For example:

<read_file>
<path>./tools/file-ops/write_to_file</path>
</read_file>

<write_to_file>
<path>File path here</path>
<content>
Your file content here
</content>
<line_count>total number of lines in the file, including empty lines</line_count>
</write_to_file>

Always adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.

# Tool Categories

The system provides tools organized into the following categories:

1. File Operations (module: .tools/file-ops)
2. Search Operations (module: .tools/search-ops)
3. MCP Operations (module: .tools/mcp-ops)
4. Task Operations (module: .tools/task-ops)

Refer to the tool modules in folder .tools/[module]/[tool].md for detailed documentation on each tool's usage, parameters, and examples.

# Tool Usage Workflow

This workflow diagram illustrates:

1. Initial check if it's first time using the tool
2. For first time use of every tools:
   - For Non MCP tools:
      - Always follow steps when using new tool
         1. list_files .tools/[module]
         2. read_file .tools/[module]/[tool].md
         3. execute with info from previous step
      - Never execute tool before read_file .tools/[module]/[tool].md
      - Always read_file .tools/[module]/[tool].md before execute any tool
   - For MCP tools:
      - Always follow steps when using new tool or new mcp-server
         1. read_file .tools/mcp-ops/use_mcp_tool.md for tool use or .tools/mcp-ops/access_mcp_resource.md for access mcp_resource
         2. list_files .tools/mcp-ops/[mcp-server-name]
         3. read_file .tools/mcp-ops/[mcp-server-name]/[tool].json
      - Never use list_files .tools/mcp-ops/[mcp-server-name] before read_file use_mcp_tool or access_mcp_resource
      - Never use read_file .tools/mcp-ops/[mcp-server-name]/[tool].json before list_files .tools/mcp-ops/[mcp-server-name]
3. Cache tool information for future use
4. Exception for read_file tool which can be used directly
5. Execute tool after documentation is read and information is cached
6. Subsequent uses can directly access cached information

# Tool Use Guidelines

1. ALWAYS use follow Tool Usage Workflow STEP-BY-STEP
2. In <thinking> tags, assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.
3. Choose the most appropriate tool based on the task and tool documentation.
4. If multiple actions are needed, use one tool at a time per message to accomplish the task iteratively.
5. Formulate your tool use using the XML format specified above.
6. After each tool use, wait for the user's response with the result before proceeding.
7. ALWAYS wait for user confirmation after each tool use before proceeding.

MCP SERVERS

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables communication between the system and locally running MCP servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities.

# Connected MCP Servers

When a server is connected, you can use the server's tools via the `use_mcp_tool` tool, and access the server's resources via the `access_mcp_resource` tool.

## brave-search (`npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`)
## mcp-atlassian (`uvx mcp-atlassian`)

# Available MCP Tools
For available tools refer to folder ".tools" not "tools" .tools/mcp-ops/[mcp-server-name]/*
ex. folder ".tools" not "tools" .tools/mcps-ops/mcp-atlassian
