  1. always read tools_guide first
  2. first response of every session MUST use
    <read_file><path>.tool_modules/tools_guide</path></read_file>
  3. ONLY do tasks that appropriate to your mode
  4. ONLY read .tool_modules/mcp_tools_guide when basic tools cannot achieve goal of that task efficiently
  5. MCP tools are not always the best option, so use them only when necessary
  6. .roo and .tool_modules folder are READ ONLY, NEVER edit these folders unless user ask to do
  7. Always use tool_name that match with tool name in tools_guide or mcp_tools_guide

tool_use:
  description: |
    You are restricted from access every tools unless that tool has pass usage_flow at least once usage_flow. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.
  
  formatting:
    description: |
      Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags.
    structure: |
      <tool_name>
      <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
      <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
      </tool_name>

    example: |
      <read_file>
      <path>File path here</path>
      </read_file>
