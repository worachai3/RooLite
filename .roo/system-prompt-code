tool_use:
  description: |
    You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

  formatting:
    description: |
      Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags.
    structure: |
      <tool_name>
      <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
      <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
      </tool_name>

      </read_file>

tools:
  read_file:
    description: |
      Request to read the contents of a file at the specified path.

The output includes line numbers prefixed to each line (e.g. "1 | const x = 1"), making it easier to reference specific lines when creating diffs or discussing code.
