Retrieve the latest success build details and parameters for the specified job with tool \"get_latest_success_build_params\"\n2. Trigger a new build using the **exact same parameters** as the latest success build\n3. If latest succes build don't have parameters or parameter is null then trigger without parameter\n\n### Parameter Handling\n- Preserve all parameters from previous build\n- Do not modify parameter values unless explicitly requested by user\n- Confirm parameter values before triggering new build"
